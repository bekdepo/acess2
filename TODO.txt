TODO:
- E1000 Driver (stubbed)
 > Find specs
   http://download.intel.com/design/network/manuals/8254x_GBe_SDM.pdf
 > Use bochs/qemu only as a backup

- Cirrus 64-bit VisualMedia Accelerator
   PCI 1013:00B8 (Cirrus CLGD5446)
 > Specs avail?
   Qemu Suggests http://home.worldonline.dk/~finth/
 > Bochs/Qemu

- UniChrome Driver

- Init Scripts
 > With an argument to init passed from the kernel?

- #!
 > Pass as argument? or pass pointer like ld-acess?
 > argc/argv - Definitely

- Network Debugging + IPv6 Autoconf
 > Should IPv6 RAs be done in kernel mode, or usermode?
 > Wait until something like linux's net.conf.ipv6.accept_ra is set?
 > Have a custom suffix for stateless IPs?

- Signals
 > Add return value to mutexs and semaphores, and add warn_unused_ret

- Virtual PCI bus for system configuration
 > Hook in drv_pci.c, with an arch-defined array of devices
 > Allow hooks on PCI config accesses (to emulate power management etc)

- VFS Path caching
 > Use a trie of path elements
 > Maintain backwards cache of elements
 > Support symlink caching too

- USB Stack
 > Check validity
 > Rework HC API to support structure used by OHCI/ECHI

- LVM Usablity
 > /Devices/LVM/by-id/ and /Devices/LVM/by-label

- AxWin3
 > Text editor (with a GP formatted text field?)
 > Maybe a basic web browser using the surface support?

- Omnispeak
 > Debug speed issues (tracing agian)
 > Port to AxWin3

- Port dropbear!
