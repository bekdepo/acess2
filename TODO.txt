- E1000 Driver (stubbed)
 > Find specs

 > Use bochs/qemu only as a backup
- Cirrus 64-bit VisualMedia Accelerator
   PCI 1013:00B8 (Cirrus CLGD5446)
 > Specs avail?
   Qemu Suggests http://home.worldonline.dk/~finth/
 > Bochs/Qemu
- UniChrome Driver
- Init Scripts
 > With an argument to init passed from the kernel?
- #!
 > Pass as argument? or pass pointer like ld-acess?
 > argc/argv - Definitely
- Network Debugging + IPv6 Autoconf
 > Should IPv6 RAs be done in kernel mode, or usermode?
 > Wait until something like linux's net.conf.ipv6.accept_ra is set?
 > Have a custom suffix for stateless IPs?
- Signals
 > Add return value to mutexs and semaphores, and add warn_unused_ret
- Virtual PCI bus for system configuration
- VFS Path caching
 > Use a trie of path elements
 > Maintain backwards cache of elements
 > Support symlink caching too
