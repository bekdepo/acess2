select()
- Implemented using a wait queue for every file descriptor
- That requires waiting on sockets to be centeralised

All wait tasks (reads on VTerm, Pipes, PTYs, network sockets) use the kernel
version of select with an inifinite timeout.
They then signal the VFS using their VFS node pointer as a reference

The VFS function select()
- Maintains a list of processes on each node (if select has been called on that node)
- Each process maybe has a semaphore on it (to use the semaphore code to maintain the process list)
 > Could maybe use a mutex instead
