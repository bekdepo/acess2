PTYs

Need support for toggling echo and line buffering
- This needs to be communicated to pty owner somehow
 > Second FD? Nominated data structure? Out of band data?
- API for the pty control?
 > "_SysSetFileFlag"/"_SysGetFileFlag"?
   Provides arbitary flags for each node
   E.g. Terminal graphics mode, echo and buffering
