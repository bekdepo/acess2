Server-side rendering primitives:
 # Apply to regions, rendered in fixed order, each has an ID
> Auto-scaling bitmaps
 - Control backed by an image with three five regions per axis
  Edge Fixed, Fill, Center Fixed, Fill, Edge Fixed
 - Definition is via two pixel counts (edge width, fill width), rest is derived
 - Command to switch backing image to another already provided
> Tiling bitmaps + filled rects
> Text (single line)
> Canvas (Takes drawing commands, draws to internal buffer)
> Shared buffer (of an unspecified pixel format)
