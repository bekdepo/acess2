Upon binding:

1. Enumerate connectors (types and possible inputs)
2. For all engines that can have their input be -1, get pixel format
  a. Parse operator list into a tree
3. Create MIN(n_conns,n_edge) video devices
  a. Each device represents an edge engine (engine selected on modeset)

Notes:
- Need to figure out what engine(s) to use as framebuffer, and what ones to use as cursor
 > Allow user/admin intervention to set these relations (based on an identifier from the driver)
