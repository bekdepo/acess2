 Acess2
========

Acess2 is [TPG]'s hobby operating system.

The Acess kernel is SEMI-posix compilant, but will be a comatability
library that emulates the different functions.

=== Source Tree ===
--- /Kernel ---
The /Kernel tree contains the kernel sources.
 Within the root of the tree is the miscelanious architecture agnostic
   code for managing threads, loading modules and other things.
 /Kernel/arch/<archname> - Architecture dependent code
 /Kernel/bin - Binary file format parsers. Takes a binary file and
   convertes it into a binary object that the loader can then load into memory.
 /Kernel/vfs - The Virtual Filesystem
 /Kernel/vfs/fs - The various filesystem drivers for the VFS.
 /Kernel/drv - Drivers

--- Usermode ---
/Usermode contains the base acess system
 /Usermode/Applications - Usermode applications such as the default
   command shell and the login shell.
 /Usermode/Libraries - Usermode shared libraries and crt0.o, currently
   implemented are libacess (kernel interface), a basic libc and ld-acess
   (dynamic linker).
 /Usermode/include - Required include files for the shared libraries.
